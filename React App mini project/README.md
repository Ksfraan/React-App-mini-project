## Technologies Used

The Ironhack Marketplace is built using a range of modern technologies and tools, ensuring a robust and scalable application. Below is a list of the key technologies involved in our project:

### Frontend

- **React**: Our application's user interface is built using React, a powerful JavaScript library for building dynamic and responsive UIs. React's component-based architecture makes our code more reusable and easier to maintain.
- **React Router**: For navigation and handling of different routes in our single-page application, we use React Router. This allows us to create a seamless and efficient navigation experience.
  **PropTypes**: Utilized for type-checking our component props, ensuring that the components receive the correct type of data.
- **CSS3 and HTML5**: For designing and structuring our web pages, providing an attractive and intuitive user interface.

### State Management and Data Handling

- **useState and useEffect Hooks**: These React hooks are instrumental in managing state and handling lifecycle events in our functional components.
- **UUID**: The 'uuid' library is used for generating unique identifiers, particularly useful in our case for assigning distinct IDs to new product entries.

### Forms and Data Submission

- **Form Handling**: Our application includes sophisticated form handling mechanisms for adding and updating product data, ensuring a seamless user experience.

### Images and Media

- **Image Handling**: We efficiently handle and display images associated with products, enhancing the visual appeal and informativeness of our product listings.

### Development Tools and Practices

- **ESLint/Prettier**: These tools are integral to our development process, ensuring code quality and consistency across the project.
- **Git and GitHub**: Our version control system of choice, enabling efficient collaboration and code management.
- **Responsive Web Design**: We adhere to responsive design principles, ensuring our application is accessible and functional across various devices and screen sizes.
